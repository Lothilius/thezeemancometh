Code for analyzing Fabry-Perot etalon interference patterns

Use with images that have been converted to pixel matrices and have been reduced to a single color.

Single colors are represented by intensity. i.e. RGB => {2,35,27} is reduced to {35} to deal with only green values.

 Meant for use with the central pixel cross section of the interference pattern.

 The purpose is to be able to pull out intensity peaks to find the spatial frequency.
