Code for analyzing Fabry-Perot etalon interference patterns

Use with images that have been converted to pixel matrices and have been reduced to a single color.

Single colors are represented by intensity. i.e. RGB => {2,35,27} is reduced to {0,35,0} to deal with only green values.

 Meant for use with the central pixel cross section of the interference pattern.
